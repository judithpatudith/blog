      <description>Why write another intro to Git? I feel nervous using systems that I don’t understand. When I started work as Mesosphere’s community manager, I needed to learn a basic Git workflow quickly so that I could begin maintaining our open source project’s website right away. But, I had a hard time understanding the workflow because I didn’t quite understand the point of using Git.
The process of forking, cloning, pulling, branching, saving, testing, adding, commenting, committing, pushing, testing again, discussing, and then going six rounds of this process — just to improve website copy — seemed like gross, jargony overkill.</description>
