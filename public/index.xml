      <description>A pull request is a GitHub-specific concept that allows repository (repo) maintainers to compare changes you request with the current versions of the files you&amp;rsquo;re changing. For background on the process of changing files with Git see introductions one and two.
What&amp;rsquo;s the point of a Pull Request? A Pull Request (PR) is a collection of commits that you ask to copy from one branch of a project to another, plus metadata that GitHub provides to help you and your reviewer talk about the changes in those commits.</description>

      <title>Git for Skeptics: Part 2 - Why is saving changes so freaking complicated?</title>

      <description>In my last post I explained why you need to copy a repo so many times to edit it with Git. Don’t know what a “repo” is? See Part 1.
In this post, I’ll explain why saving a change with Git is so complicated. Each step accomplishes a separate goal and serves as a checkpoint where you can backtrack or edit. The whole process includes making testable modifications, grouping those changes by goal or step, explaining your groups of changes and assigning them to a branch, putting the changed branch online, and asking your reviewer to have a look.</description>

      <description>Why write another intro to Git? I feel nervous using systems that I don’t understand. When I started work as Mesosphere’s community manager, I needed to learn a basic Git workflow quickly so that I could begin maintaining our open source project’s website right away. But, I had a hard time understanding the workflow because I didn’t quite understand the point of using Git.
The process of forking, cloning, pulling, branching, saving, testing, adding, commenting, committing, pushing, testing again, discussing, and then going six rounds of this process — just to improve website copy — seemed like gross, jargony overkill.</description>
