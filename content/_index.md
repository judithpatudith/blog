# Built by humans, still confusing.

My training is in evolutionary developmental biology, a field where randomness
rules. When I got a job in tech, I was excited to work with logical systems
built by humans.

But I'm slowly discovering that the logic I had hoped for isn't always obvious,
especially to beginners like me. So here I set out to explain things as I figure
them out.
