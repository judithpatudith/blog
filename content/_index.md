# Tech doesn't make sense to beginners

My training is in evolutionary developmental biology, where random mutation and ever-changing selection shape the world. Coming into tech, I was excited about the prospect of working in a field where all the systems were built by humans, and where everything exists for a reason.

That reason isn't always clear, and tech can be a confusing place for beginners. Even processes built on purpose can seem random at times. I'm setting out to explain these processes, and help the world make sense.
