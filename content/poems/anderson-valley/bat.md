summary: "A poem for the women who hung themselves here."
---

Thereâ€™s a bat in the house again.\
I hear her skin wings\
cutting an unpredictable path\
through the stagnant air.

Confused and flustered,\
she tires herself out\
in her desperation to escape\
and hangs on a rafter to rest.

I cup her little bones\
in heavy leather gloves.\
I feel her frail, tiny heart beat.\
But I know she could be dangerous.

She's familiar, but not like us enough\
to live in here with me.\
A mammal that has broken\
from the pull of the earth.

So, I release her to the wide open night.\
I hope she flies back to bat friends and\
huddles up in the morning, in a dark, warm spot\
somewhere safe that feels like belonging.

I know her feeling in the house sometimes:\
anxious and out of place.\
How did I get here?\
How do I leave?

Although there are no leather gloves\
to scoop me up and put me back where I belong,\
I know those rafters are here for me too\
if the echos ever get too loud for me

to find my way outside\
into the open air.
