description: "What does it feel like to fossilize?"
---

Your black satin sheets\
slid over my body\
like oily shale layers\
trapping my petrified imprint\
and reducing it to evidence.\
The fossil of an alien being\
mysterious and long extinct.

Soft tissue shouldn’t preserve\
but anoxic, you fixed\
and then calcified me;\
a suffocating mudslide\
on the floor of the sea.\
What was left of me is\
now replaced by rock.\
A piece of me that never\
left that bed.

Once marine, now subterranean,\
the land that trapped me\
has slowly eroded to dust.\
I’ve waited for geological time\
only to be exposed by\
a new man, a paleontologist,\
who will wonder at the testimony\
to the monsters my kind\
has always known.

His touch is a gentle stroke\
from a soft paintbrush.\
Barely enough to call sensation\
after the pounds of pressure\
I knew in the sea.\
He moves me to a museum.\
Preserves me on a pedestal\
in a glass case\
although I'm made of stone\
and have survived for millennia.

Arthropod, Annelid?\
Even my phylum a beguiling mystery,\
he labels me with his new name,\
a thin mark on fragile paper,\
a twitch in the oxygen-bloated air.\
Nothing like my true and ancient one.\
My old name was an electric pulse.\
An odor diffusing through the water.\
Turbulence in the boundary layer.\
Fear in those who were my prey.\
But just an opportunity for you,\
the only force that could topple me,\
a predator above my apex.
