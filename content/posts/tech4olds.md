# Who is the analog generation?

If typing was a skill you learned in a class, you probably belong to the last analog generation: the last generation who became adults when instantaneous communication was only possible by voice. If the most natural way for you to ask someone a quick question is to call them on the phone, you might belong to the analog generation.

# What makes digital communication different?

With the rise of email, instant messenger, social media, direct messaging, and video calls we have more ways than ever to get in touch with people. Most of these forms of communication look kind of similar to things you're familiar with, like mail or the phone, but they are not all interchangeable with traditional channels, or with each other.  

Digital natives (people who grew up with instantaneous, text-based communication) use these channels in different ways in order to keep their messages organized, maintain personal boundaries, and to stay safe on the internet. These systems can look arbitrary to older people, but they are governed by some common principles, which I hope to explain below.

# Why should I care about the norms of digital communication?

The short answer: to get a hold of your kids, grand kids, nieces, and nephews, and to avoid hurt feelings and miscommunication.

If you have ever waited weeks to get a response to a Facebook message, only to get an instantaneous reply from the same person to a public post, you may have run afoul of the unspoken rules of digital communication. This delay can feel bad, and you might assume that the person you're trying to talk to doesn't want to hear from you.

Even worse, you may have gotten back a frustrated reply from a digital native saying “please don’t contact me this way.” Why should your well-meaning message on a shiny new communication platform garner such a strong response? Because you haven't conformed to the norms that young people have put in place to stay safe: the norms of digital communication.

## Stranger danger in the digital age

Staying safe on the internet is a very different skill than staying safe in real life. If you are a parent, you probably taught your children “stranger danger” when they were young. The idea was that strangers who talk to children might be dangerous, and you wanted to give your kids a sense of caution around people they don’t know.

On the internet, things are different. Talking with strange people is relatively safe as long as you communicate over a safe channel. It isn’t strange people, but strange messages or platforms that can be dangerous.

For example in an email, misformatted text, odd subject lines, weird attachments, unfamiliar addresses, and typos are all signs that a message might be dangerous. It could be sent from someone trying to impersonate a friend or family member. It could contain attachments with viruses.

These traits are all signs to a digital native that they shouldn’t interact with the message, and should probably throw it away, just to be safe. The same danger markers that digital natives avoid are unfortunately also hallmarks of emails from older people who are less likely understand text formatting or file extensions and aren’t fluent at typing.

To compound things even further, people who don’t recognize these danger signs are more likely to get hacked and pass on dangerous content. When you get a slow or annoyed response from a digital native, part of the feeling contributing to that response could be fear. Sending a message with one or more of these warning signs is the equivalent of asking you kid out lunch and picking them up in a black, unmarked van while wearing a clown mask. Stranger danger.

## Information overload

Digital natives are used to being bombarded with messages and alerts from every direction. They manage this chaos by ignoring messages that aren’t from humans, putting off complex responses till later, and turning off notifications that don't require an immediate response.

These protective mechanisms can look rude to the analog generation (and it can feel rude when a response is slow or doesn’t come at all), but for digital natives, they’re tactics for staying sane and present.

If you have trouble understanding your computer because you are overwhelmed and distracted by notifications as soon as you turn it on, you might benefit from adopting some of these strategies too. On the internet, your attention is a precious commodity. If you give it to everyone who asks for it you will quickly hit information overload. Older people can feel obligated to respond to every pop up and alert because they are worried about missing out or appearing rude.

Considering the following factors might make ignoring pop-ups or disabling notifications feel less un-natural.

1. Most pop-ups and notifications are automated. They might look like they come from a particular human and are intended just for you, but they aren’t. They’re customized form messages, like junk mail or robocalls. If you wouldn’t spend time reading every piece of junk mail you get, you probably don't need to enable or read notifications for most apps on your phone or web pages you visit.

1. Of the few real communications from humans, a tiny fraction are urgent. The people who matter to you (your parents, kids, partner, best friend, or dog sitter) will have your phone number and can call or text in an emergency. That means that you don't need to immediately look at the notifications you get from digital channels. That cat video can wait until you have time.

  You can probably even ignore calls from unknown phone numbers. The really important people in your life should be in your phone contacts, and strangers with urgent messages will either call back a second time or leave a voicemail.

## Where were we talking about that?

Organizing digital information is very different than organizing hard-copy information. When you want to save a letter someone send you, you only have a few options for how to file the letter so you can find it again (maybe based on date, or alphabetically by the sender’s name).

But if you send a digital message on the right platform you will be able to search for it based on almost any information you have about it: a set of words in the file, title, date, author, labels, and more. When digital natives decide how to contact someone, they aren’t just thinking about how to get a hold of the person, but about how to find the conversation later.

The only factor that search can't span is a channel (you can't search your email and Facebook wall all at once for example). Because of this limitation, it's important to think about what kind of content you send over what channel.

### Important information

When sending messages to digital natives, the first thing to consider is whether or not you expect them to find your message again in the future. If you do think they will need to reference your message (because you’re planning an event, or having a significant conversation) it’s best to send the message on a searchable channel---probably email.

Email can be marked as unread, which lets digital natives read your message and then save it for later when they have time to respond properly. Keep in mind that email is personal. When digital natives get emails, they expect that those emails will be relevant to them (not spam, jokes, or broadcasts).

#### An aside about photos

I said that if you want someone to be able to find your message again you should use email, but the exception to this rule is photos. Photos don't display well in email, are hard to search for, and usually come as attachments which make digital natives wary of opening them at all.

If you want to share a photo, post it on social media and tag the people in the picture. Tagging will add the photos to their "photos of me" section and let them know they've been tagged.

Don't tag people who aren't in the photo; they will probably see your post in their feed, on their own time. If a picture is very relevant to someone who isn't in it (maybe you baked a cake with their name on it, or are wearing a shit they just gave you and you want to say thanks) you can mention them in the post. Don't tag them in the picture.

### Playful communications

If you don’t think the recipient will need to find your message again, the next thing to consider is whether or not the message you want to send is specifically and only for them.

#### Stuff you just like

If you find something funny but it doesn't remind you of anyone in particular, post it on your own Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter feed. Don’t mention anyone else in the post unless the post reminds you specifically of them. Without mentions, your social media posts don’t alert anyone, but your followers will see and appreciate your posts on their own time when they aren’t busy.

#### Safe-for-work content for someone specific

If the message you want to send is intended for someone specific, but doesn't need to be private, you can post it on their social media feed or mention them in your post. Keeping messages like this public allows other people to engage with the post too, which is why social media has gained popularity. This is great way to share articles, for example. Not only can the recipient read the article, they can also discuss it with you and their friends.

#### Unimportant private communications

If your message is disposable, personal, and private, this is a good use case for social media direct messages, including Facebook or Instagram messenger. For example, if you find an off-color joke on Facebook that you want to share with your significant other, that’s a good use case for Facebook messenger.

Use direct messages sparingly. Social media messages can interrupt someone with a notification, so it’s best to use it when you want to privately tell the recipient “I’m thinking of you now”. Messages here might be time sensitive, but shouldn’t be important.

### Don't mix messages

Try not to mix real messages and spam on the same platform. When you send spam, memes, or non-personalized information directly to people, they will pay less attention to your messages. If you then follow up on the same platform with real information they could ignore it, assuming its spam. If you send memes over email, recipients might not feel safe opening your emails because they could contain dangerous content or attachments.  

# Key take aways

So, what steps can you take to be a better digital communicator?

1. Write thoughtful subject lines, proofread your messages, and check them for formatting (or leave formatting settings to the default). Good writing and plain formatting make people feel more at ease, no matter what generation they belong to.
1. Turn off your notifications, and when in doubt ignore or close your popup windows; anyone who needs to get a hold of you will call or text from a familiar number.
1. Don’t use the same communication for personal, important communications and more general interest messages; If you need to plan with people use email.
1. Remember that when in doubt, digital natives will put off responding to your messages. Cutting down on noise and ambiguity will help your message get through.

In future posts, I’d like to go into do’s and don’ts for specific communication platforms. If any of these tips have been helpful, or there are specific digital communication questions you'd like me to answer, either for you or for a relative, please don't hesitate ask. Suggestions are welcome!
