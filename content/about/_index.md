# Judith E.L. Malnick

I am an open source educator who enjoys navigating the relationships between technology, community, and business. An analytic approach to challenges and a strong sense of empathy help me understand and collaborate with others. I have developed these skills over eleven years managing communities, researching, teaching, writing, and counseling.
